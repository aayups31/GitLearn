DraftText is an editable production script or brief; steps describe concrete editing decisions.`,

Separate observations, hypotheses and recommended experiments. Never relabel manual reports as settled sales or infer course completion from clicks. Suggest bounded changes to Growth or Academy with source IDs; never change a campaign or course yourself. DraftText is an evidence brief, not promotional copy.`,
